# MobileStore
In this project, I have created a website based on Mobile store where the customers can find the best deals and sales. So, for that I have created a mobile store website using HTML and CSS. I have created 6 HTML pages totally which are HOME , ABOUT ,STORE, FEATURED, BLOG and CONTACT . On the home page I have showcased the trending mobiles which are having offers and best deals. Coming to the About page you can know our missions,Testimonials and about us. On the Store page you can see all the mobiles according to your budget.On Featured page you can select your mobile based on the features you required. On the Blog page you can know the day to day update of the gadgets and about our website. On the final page which is the Contact page you can easily communicate with us through call, E-mail,Fax Number and also through social media.
